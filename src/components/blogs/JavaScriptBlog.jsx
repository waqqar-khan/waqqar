      question:
        "What is the difference between '==' and '===' operators in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "'==' checks for equality with type coercion, meaning it converts values to the same type before comparing them. For example, '1' == 1 is true because the string '1' is converted to the number 1. On the other hand, '===' checks for equality without type coercion, so '1' === 1 is false as the types are different (string vs. number).",
    },
    {
      question: "What are closures in JavaScript and why are they important?",
      answer:
        "Closures are functions that maintain access to variables from their outer function even after the outer function has returned. This allows the inner function to retain the environment where it was created. Closures are important for encapsulating data, creating private variables, and enabling functional programming patterns like function factories and maintaining state.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the JavaScript event loop work?",
      answer:
        "The event loop manages the execution of code, handles asynchronous operations, and processes events in JavaScript. It continuously checks the call stack and the task queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the first task from the queue and pushes it onto the stack to be executed. This allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks like I/O operations without blocking the main execution thread.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between 'let', 'const', and 'var'?",
      answer:
        "'var' is function-scoped, meaning it's available throughout the function where it's declared, and can be redeclared and updated. 'let' and 'const' are block-scoped, available only within the block where they are defined. 'const' is used for variables that cannot be reassigned, while 'let' allows reassignment. Unlike 'var', 'let' and 'const' do not suffer from hoisting issues.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are promises in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Promises are objects that represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. They allow you to handle asynchronous code more gracefully compared to traditional callbacks. A promise can be in one of three states: pending, resolved (fulfilled), or rejected. You use methods like 'then' for handling resolved values and 'catch' for handling errors.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of async/await in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Async/await is a syntactic sugar built on top of promises, designed to simplify writing asynchronous code. An 'async' function always returns a promise, and 'await' pauses the execution of the async function until the promise is resolved or rejected. This makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability and maintainability.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has a prototype object that it inherits from. When accessing a property or method, JavaScript first looks at the object itself, and if itâ€™s not found, it looks at the prototype chain. This allows for shared behavior and properties across multiple objects.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'this' keyword in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "'this' refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value is determined by how the function is called. For example, 'this' in a method refers to the object that owns the method, 'this' in a constructor function refers to the instance being created, and 'this' in a regular function refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode).",
    },
    {
      question: "How can you handle errors in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Errors in JavaScript can be handled using try-catch blocks. Code that may throw an error is placed inside the 'try' block, and error-handling code is placed inside the 'catch' block. This allows you to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent the script from crashing. Optionally, you can use 'finally' to execute code after the try-catch block regardless of whether an error was thrown.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Synchronous code is executed line-by-line and blocks further execution until the current task is complete. Asynchronous code, on the other hand, allows other code to run while waiting for longer operations (like I/O or network requests) to finish. Asynchronous code can be managed using callbacks, promises, or async/await to avoid blocking the main thread and improve performance.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are higher-order functions in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Higher-order functions are functions that either take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. This allows you to abstract over actions and create more flexible code. For example, functions like 'map', 'filter', and 'reduce' are higher-order functions because they take a function as an argument to apply to each element in an array. Higher-order functions are useful for managing complexity by promoting code reuse and enabling functional programming patterns.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the module pattern in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "The module pattern is a design pattern that encapsulates code into reusable units, using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to create a private scope. This pattern helps in hiding implementation details and exposing only the public API. For example, you might use an IIFE to create a module that contains private variables and functions, and return an object with public methods. This helps in organizing code and managing dependencies while avoiding polluting the global namespace.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What are arrow functions and how do they differ from regular functions?",
      answer:
        "Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions and do not have their own 'this' context. Instead, they inherit 'this' from the surrounding lexical scope. This makes arrow functions particularly useful for callbacks and methods where you want to maintain the 'this' value from the enclosing context. For instance, inside an arrow function, 'this' refers to the object that contains the function. Unlike regular functions, arrow functions also cannot be used as constructors and do not have access to the 'arguments' object.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the spread operator and how is it used?",
      answer:
        "The spread operator (...) allows an iterable (like an array or string) to be expanded into individual elements in places where multiple arguments or elements are expected. It is useful for various tasks such as copying arrays, merging arrays, and spreading elements into function arguments. For example, '[...arr]' creates a shallow copy of the array 'arr', while 'Math.max(...arr)' finds the maximum value in the array by spreading its elements as individual arguments.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is destructuring in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Destructuring is a syntax feature that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables in a more concise way. For arrays, you can use syntax like '[a, b] = [1, 2]' to assign the values 1 and 2 to 'a' and 'b', respectively. For objects, you can use syntax like '{x, y} = {x: 1, y: 2}' to assign the properties 'x' and 'y' to variables with the same names. Destructuring simplifies code by reducing the need for multiple lines of variable assignment.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is event delegation in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element to manage events for its child elements. This takes advantage of event bubbling, where events propagate up through the DOM tree from the target element to the parent elements. By attaching the listener to a parent element, you can handle events for dynamically added child elements without needing to attach individual listeners to each child. This approach improves performance and simplifies event management, especially in cases where many child elements are involved.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you prevent default behavior for events in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "To prevent the default behavior of an event, you can use the 'event.preventDefault()' method within an event handler. This method stops the default action associated with the event from being executed. For example, in a form submission event, calling 'preventDefault()' prevents the form from being submitted and allows you to handle the submission process manually. This is particularly useful for handling custom logic in response to events and preventing unwanted browser default actions.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is JSON and how do you work with it in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. In JavaScript, you can convert objects to JSON strings using 'JSON.stringify()' and parse JSON strings back into objects using 'JSON.parse()'. This is commonly used for exchanging data between a client and a server. For example, 'const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj)' converts an object 'obj' to a JSON string, and 'const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString)' converts it back to an object.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a callback function in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed after the completion of that function. Callbacks are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations, such as making API requests or handling events. For example, in an asynchronous API call, you might pass a callback function to handle the response once the data is received. This approach allows you to define custom behavior that should occur once the asynchronous operation is complete.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between 'null' and 'undefined' in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "'undefined' means that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It is the default value for uninitialized variables. 'null', on the other hand, is an explicit assignment value used to represent 'no value' or a non-existent reference. For instance, you might set a variable to 'null' to indicate that it should eventually hold an object but currently does not. While both 'null' and 'undefined' represent the absence of a value, 'null' is explicitly assigned, while 'undefined' is automatically assigned by the JavaScript engine.",
    },
    // above
    {
      question: "How do you create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "A deep copy of an object can be created using structuredClone(), or by converting the object to a JSON string and parsing it back into an object using 'JSON.stringify()' and 'JSON.parse()'. However, this method does not handle functions, special objects like Date, or circular references.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the purpose of the 'use strict' directive in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "'use strict' is a directive that enforces stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript code. It helps catch common coding errors and prevents the use of some unsafe features.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you define a class in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "A class in JavaScript can be defined using the 'class' keyword, which introduces a new syntax for creating constructor functions and handling inheritance through prototypes.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between 'call', 'apply', and 'bind' methods?",
      answer:
        "'call' and 'apply' are used to invoke a function with a specified 'this' context and arguments, with 'call' accepting a list of arguments and 'apply' accepting an array of arguments. 'bind' returns a new function with a specified 'this' context and preset arguments.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are template literals in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Template literals are string literals enclosed by backticks (``) that allow embedded expressions and multi-line strings. They support interpolation using '${expression}' syntax.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle asynchronous operations using promises?",
      answer:
        "Asynchronous operations using promises are handled by creating a new Promise object and using its 'then' and 'catch' methods to define callbacks for success and failure cases, respectively.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a generator function and how is it used?",
      answer:
        "A generator function is defined using the 'function*' syntax and can yield multiple values over time, pausing and resuming its execution with 'yield' and 'next()' methods.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between 'slice' and 'splice' methods in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "'slice' creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array, while 'splice' changes the contents of an array by adding, removing, or replacing elements in place.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you create a module in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "A module in JavaScript can be created using the ES6 module syntax, which involves using 'export' to expose variables, functions, or classes, and 'import' to include them in other files.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the event propagation in JavaScript?",
      answer:
        "Event propagation is the order in which events are received on an element and its ancestors. It includes three phases: capturing phase, target phase, and bubbling phase.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are JavaScript data types?",
