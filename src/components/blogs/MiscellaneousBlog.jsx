      question: "What is the purpose of a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?",

      question: "What is the difference between REST and GraphQL?",
      answer:
        "REST uses multiple endpoints to access different resources and requires multiple requests to gather related data. GraphQL allows you to query exactly the data you need in a single request, using a flexible schema.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)?",
      answer:
        "CI is the practice of automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository frequently. CD extends this by automatically deploying changes to production, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of a Service Worker?",

    {
      question:
        "How does the caret (^) and tilde (~) symbols affect package versions in package.json?",
      answer:
        "The caret (^) will update to a minor patch update version, and the tilde (~) will update to a major patch update version. It is always safer to update to a minor version because a major version may break many thingsâ€‹.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between package-lock.json and package.json?",
      answer:
        "package-lock.json records the exact version of each package installed, while package.json records the version ranges. Both files should be committed to GitHub to ensure consistency across environments.",
