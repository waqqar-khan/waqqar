        "How can you test user interactions such as clicks and form submissions using React Testing Library?",
      answer:
        "To test user interactions like clicks and form submissions using React Testing Library, use the `fireEvent` or `userEvent` utilities. For example, use `fireEvent.click(buttonElement)` to simulate a click event on a button or `userEvent.type(inputElement, 'text')` to simulate typing in an input field. After simulating interactions, use assertions to verify that the expected changes occur in the component's state or the rendered output. These utilities help ensure that components handle user interactions correctly.",

      question:
        "How do you handle asynchronous behavior in tests with React Testing Library?",
      answer:
        "Handle asynchronous behavior in tests with React Testing Library by using `await` with `findBy` queries. For example, `await screen.findByText('Loading...')` waits for an element to appear in the DOM. React Testing Library provides `findBy` queries for locating elements that appear asynchronously, ensuring that tests wait for elements to be rendered before making assertions. Additionally, use `waitFor` to wait for specific conditions or updates in the component, ensuring that tests accurately reflect asynchronous behavior.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What are some best practices for writing tests with React Testing Library?",
      answer:
        "Best practices for writing tests with React Testing Library include: 1) Focus on testing user interactions and component behavior rather than implementation details. 2) Use queries that reflect how users interact with the UI, such as `getByText` and `getByRole`. 3) Keep tests simple and readable by writing clear and descriptive test cases. 4) Avoid using `wait` or `setTimeout` unless necessary, and prefer `findBy` queries for handling asynchronous behavior. 5) Ensure tests are maintainable and reflect real-world usage scenarios.",
