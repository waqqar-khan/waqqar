      question: "What is Next.js?",
      answer:
        "Next.js is a React framework that provides a set of tools and features for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications with ease. It simplifies the process of building and deploying React applications by offering features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js?",
      answer:
        "Server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js refers to the process of rendering pages on the server for each request. This means the HTML is generated on the server, sent to the client, and then hydrated with React on the client side. SSR improves SEO and can provide faster initial page loads.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is static site generation (SSG) in Next.js?",
      answer:
        "Static site generation (SSG) in Next.js refers to generating HTML at build time rather than on each request. This allows pages to be pre-rendered into static HTML files, which are served to users quickly and efficiently, enhancing performance and scalability.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Next.js handle routing?",
      answer:
        "Next.js uses a file-based routing system where the file structure in the 'pages' directory corresponds to the routes of the application. Each file in 'pages' automatically becomes a route, and dynamic routes can be created using file naming conventions with brackets (e.g., [id].js).",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of 'getStaticProps' in Next.js?",
      answer:
        "'getStaticProps' is an async function that runs at build time in Next.js. It allows you to fetch data and pass it as props to a page component, enabling static generation of pages with dynamic content based on the fetched data.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of 'getServerSideProps' in Next.js?",
      answer:
        "'getServerSideProps' is an async function that runs on the server for each request. It allows you to fetch data and pass it as props to a page component, enabling server-side rendering with data fetched at request time.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of 'getStaticPaths' in Next.js?",
      answer:
        "'getStaticPaths' is an async function used in conjunction with 'getStaticProps' to define dynamic routes for static generation. It returns a list of paths that should be statically generated, allowing Next.js to build pages for those paths at build time.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What is the difference between 'getStaticProps' and 'getServerSideProps'?",
      answer:
        "'getStaticProps' is used for static site generation and runs at build time, while 'getServerSideProps' is used for server-side rendering and runs on every request. 'getStaticProps' is ideal for content that doesn’t change often, whereas 'getServerSideProps' is suited for dynamic data that changes frequently.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Next.js handle API routes?",
      answer:
        "Next.js handles API routes by creating files in the 'pages/api' directory. Each file exports an API route handler, which allows you to build API endpoints directly within your Next.js application. These API routes are serverless functions that can handle requests and responses.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is 'Incremental Static Regeneration' (ISR) in Next.js?",
      answer:
        "Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to update static content after the site has been built and deployed. You can specify a revalidation period, and Next.js will regenerate the static page in the background when a request is made after the specified time.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'Link' component in Next.js?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "How does the 'Image' component in Next.js optimize images?",
      answer:
        "The 'Image' component in Next.js optimizes images by automatically resizing, compressing, and serving images in modern formats (like WebP) based on the user’s device and browser. It also provides built-in lazy loading for improved performance.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'App' component in Next.js?",
      answer:
        "The 'App' component in Next.js, defined in '_app.js', is used to initialize pages and allows you to wrap your pages with additional providers or global layout components. It is a top-level component that can be used for setting up global state or styles.",

    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'Static Folder' in Next.js?",
      answer:
        "The 'static' folder, located at the root of the project, is used to serve static assets such as images, fonts, and other files. Files in this folder are served from the root URL path, making them accessible directly without any processing by Next.js.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Next.js handle CSS and other static files?",
      answer:
        "Next.js supports importing CSS files and other static assets directly into your components. CSS modules are supported by default, allowing for scoped styles, and static assets can be placed in the 'public' directory for direct access.",

      question: "What is 'Custom Document' in Next.js?",
      answer:
        "'Custom Document' is a feature in Next.js that allows you to customize the HTML document structure of your application. By creating a '_document.js' file, you can modify the initial HTML structure, including the 'head' and 'body' tags, to add global styles or scripts.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is 'Custom App' in Next.js?",
      answer:
