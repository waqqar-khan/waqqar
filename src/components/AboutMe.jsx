          <h3>Senior Frontend Developer (React.JS)</h3>
          <p>
            Seasoned in the world of Frontend development, with a robust
            background spanning over 4 years, I bring forth exceptional
            expertise as a frontend developer. My journey in the tech realm has
            seen me excel in multiple domains, including Enterprise Platform
            Development, Retail, and E-commerce.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having dedicated 3 years to mastering JavaScript and ReactJS, I
            possess an innate understanding of crafting immersive web
            experiences that captivate users. My dedication to delivering
            solutions that matter is augmented by my role as a Certified Scrum
            Product Owner® (CSPO®), championing agile methodologies that foster
            streamlined and efficient development.
          </p>

            both Agile and Waterfall methodologies, bringing flexibility and
            structure to each initiative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the lines of code, I&#39;ve worn the hat of a Technical
            Interviewer, conducting over 500 interviews. This perspective has
            enriched my skills, enhancing my ability to gauge and recognize
            top-tier talent. Furthermore, my stint as a Management Trainee
            during my bachelor&#39;s degree has provided me with a unique
            perspective on organizational dynamics and effective collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            My prowess extends beyond technical prowess alone. I&#39;ve honed
            the art of UI development leadership, offering guidance and
            mentorship to fellow developers while consistently delivering
            outcomes that redefine user experiences. My toolkit includes Full

            catalyst for innovation. I thrive on pushing boundaries and crafting
            solutions that excel not only in technical rigor but also in
            exceeding user expectations. With a blend of comprehensive skills,
            an unwavering commitment to excellence, and a passion for driving
            impactful projects, I&#39;m poised to thrive in even the most
